# web-omr
Web-based Optical Music Recognition tool that translates musical notes on monophonic scores to ABC notation and annotates the ABC notes onto the music score to facilitate the process of learning music.
This project was created in a 2 day hackathon at [YouthHacks 2019](https://youthhacks.org/). 

## Getting Started
This web app is built on a [tensorflow model](https://github.com/calvozaragoza/tf-deep-omr) built by Calvo-Zaragoza et al. published as [End-to-End Neural Optical Music Recognition of Monophonic Scores](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/4/606) in the Applied Sciences Journal 2018.
To get started, follow the steps below:

 1. Install the dependencies
